# Calculate the Average of a Set of Numbers

START
store input in the variable "scores"
for each number in "scores" add it to the variable "sum"
divide "sum" by the lenght of "scores" and store in "average"
print "average"
END


# Determine If a Number is Prime

1. START
2. store input in variable "number"
3. # first check:
        if "number" is smaller or equal to 1, if so print "not_prime"
4. # second check:  
        store "number" minus 1 in "range_max"
        check each number between 2 and "range_max" represented as "x"
        divide "number" by "x" and store rest in "remainder"
        if for any of the checked numbers the "remainder" is 0, print "not_prime"
5. if both of the checks are false, print "prime"
